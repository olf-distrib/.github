OLF has been defending the book industry in Switzerland since 1946. Its motivation has not flagged over the years; it has even increased. 
Our role as facilitator between authors and their audience has never been as relevant as it is today. 
Whether as a publisher, distributor, digital aggregator, logistics provider, books and their contents have always been the foundation of our work, regardless of the form they take.

OLF develops its strategy in such a way as to make books present and visible in the broadest range of outlets, 
because we believe in our vocation to provide people in Switzerland with the opportunity to educate or entertain themselves or otherwise satisfy their curiosity.
